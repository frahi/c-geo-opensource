[c:geo](http://www.cgeo.org) is a simple yet powerful unofficial geocaching client for Android devices. In contrast to other similar applications, c:geo doesn't require a web browser nor file exports. You can just go geocaching with your phone and without any home preparation or worries. Of course, you can go without paying - it's free.

You want to contribute?
-----------------------
Perfect! Please **tell us in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cgeo/c-geo-opensource/issues) before hacking** on your great new feature. It would be bad if you have implemented something great, but we can't include it because it doesn't fit the remaining architecture and code.

Get the source
--------------

Fork the project source code on [github](https://github.com/cgeo/c-geo-opensource):

	git clone git://github.com/cgeo/c-geo-opensource.git

Set up Eclipse
--------------

- Install an Eclipse distribution for your OS from http://eclipse.org/downloads/ (you may choose the Java developers distribution).
- Start Eclipse, choose any directory as workspace. Close the welcome screen, if it appears.
- After the workbench has started, select File | Import | Install | Install Software Items From File and select a locally downloaded copy of https://github.com/cgeo/c-geo-opensource/tree/master/main/project/eclipse%20installation/cgeo%20eclipse%20components.p2f. This way you can easily install all necessary plugins.
- After forking the project you should import the two Eclipse projects in your workspace with File | Import | Projects from Git.

Build
-----

### Prerequisites ###

- [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk) r14 including Google APIs V8
- [Ant](http://ant.apache.org) 1.6.0+ for building c:geo on the command line (not necessary when using only Eclipse)
- If you use Microsoft Windows, [Google USB Driver](http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html) to install the application on the smartphone

### Structure ###

c:geo sources and executables are located in the `main` directory. Tests are located in the `tests` directory.

### Known limitations ###

If the workspace directory name contains a space and leads to errors in the -dex Ant target, then you need to set the property "basedir" in your `local.properties` to the 8.3 name of the directory where this script is located on your disk.

### Configuration ###

1. copy `./main/templates/private.properties` to `./main/`
2. edit `private.properties` (see comments in the file)
3. copy `./main/templates/local.properties` to `./main/`
3. copy `./main/templates/local.properties` to `./tests/`
4. edit `local.properties` (see comments in the file)
5. copy `./main/templates/mapsapikey.xml` to `./main/res/values/`
6. edit `./main/res/values/mapsapikey.xml` and insert your Maps API key (see comments in the file)

### Building with Ant ###

Run one of the following commands in `./main`

    ant help
    ant clean
    ant debug
    ant release

or use the Ant view of Eclipse

### Debugging ###

1. Add android:debuggable="true" in the application settings of `AndroidManifest.xml`
2. In Eclipse, create a Debug Configuration for an Android Application using the menu Run->Debug Configurations

### Testing ###

The Test classes can be found in the project cgeo-os-test. Test classes should be located in the same package as
the class under test.
Every class can be "Run As" (or "Debug As") an "Android JUnit Test" from Eclipse.
To run all tests use the test suite in CgeoTestSuite in package cgeo.geocaching.test.
Further information can be found at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html
